/// The mixer is the center of %ge211's audio facilities. It is used to
/// load audio files as @ref Music_track%s and @ref Sound_effect%s, and
/// to play and control them. However, @ref Mixer itself has no public
/// constructor, and you will not construct your own. Rather, a @ref
/// Mixer is constructed, if possible, when @ref Abstract_game is
/// initialized, and this mixer can be accessed by your game via the
/// @ref Abstract_game::mixer member function. The member
/// function returns a reference to an uncopyable object.
///
/// This mixer has one music channel, and some fixed number (usually 8)
/// of sound effects channels. This means that it can play one @ref
/// Music_track and up to (usually) 8 @ref Sound_effect%s
/// simultaneously.
///
/// For playing background music, one @ref Music_track can be *attached*
/// to the mixer at any given time, using @ref Mixer::attach_music.
/// Once a @ref Music_track is
/// attached, it can be played with @ref Mixer::resume_music and
/// paused with @ref Mixer::pause_music. A @ref Music_track
/// can be both attached and played in one step with @ref
/// Mixer::play_music. The music channel is always in one
/// of four states, of type @ref audio::Mixer::State, which can be
/// retrieved by @ref Mixer::get_music_state. Note that the
/// validity of music operations depends on what state the mixer's music
/// channel is in. For example, it is an error to attach a @ref
/// Music_track to the mixer when music is already playing or fading
/// out.
///
/// For playing sound effects, multiple @ref Sound_effect%s can be
/// attached to the mixer simultaneously. A @ref Sound_effect is
/// attached and played using the @ref Mixer::play_effect member function,
/// which also allows specifying the volume of
/// the sound effect. If nothing further is done, the sound effect plays
/// to completion and then detaches, making room to attach more sound
/// effects; however, @ref Mixer::play_effect
/// returns a @ref Sound_effect_handle, which can be used to control the
/// sound effect while it is playing as well.
